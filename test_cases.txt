Test Suit for fakestoreapi.com:

NOTES: 
- fakestoreapi does not support any changes in the database. Any users/products/carts added will not stay in the database.
- the documentation dosn't show any response information, some can be found in the Github repository (https://github.com/keikaavousi/fake-store-api) even though it's not complete.
- to login use the users already in the database, no new users will be added to the database
- PUT method is supposed to update a object and if it doesn't exist, create a new one, PATCH only updates the object
